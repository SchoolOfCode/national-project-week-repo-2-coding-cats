# 📅 Hackaplanner (Backend) — a School of Code week project ✏

**Made with ♥ by the Coding Cats**

About the App
---
Every Friday, the School of Code bootcampers participate on a day-long hackathon where they implement their newly acquired web developing knowledge. Because they must build something from scratch in such a short period of time, it can easily get chaotic without a proper plan. Hackaplanner facilitates planning by asking the user some questions and sets up tasks and goals to track during the day.

### How to run locally
- In the project directory, run:
  - `npm install` to install dependencies
  - `npm start` to run the app in the development mode
  - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in a browser.

About the School of Code
---
The [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) is a free coding bootcamp where people from all sorts of different backgrounds can learn industry standard tools to become full stack developer at the end of the intensive course. It is an amazing community where bootcampers are supported for the duration of the course and even once it's done. You don't need to have written a single line of code before you've joined but by the end you will be building full stack applications using agile methodologies. This project is one of the two full stack applications bootcampers build within a team of new people.

### The Coding Cats
We didn't know each other before the start of this project, but we managed to become a great team in just a week and we're proud of that. We ideated, designed and built this app in less than a week. We chose the team name somewhat randomly, but it's catchy so it works!

Team members:
- [Tom || @tmserl](https://github.com/tmserl)
- [Ashlie || @ashliecodes](https://github.com/ashliecodes)
- [Max || @mmuller2](https://github.com/mmuller2)
- [Enia || @eniabellver](https://github.com/eniabellver)
